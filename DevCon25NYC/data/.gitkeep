# Data folder

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Put all your personal data files here!**

This folder is in `.gitignore` to prevent accidentally committing personal data to GitHub.

Supported file types (all ignored by git):
- CSV files (`.csv`)
- JSON files (`.json` - except package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
- MBOX files (`.mbox`)
- Text files with data (`.txt`)
- Excel files (`.xlsx`)
- Any other data files

## Usage

```bash
# Download your data and put it here
cp ~/Downloads/my-bank-transactions.csv data/
cp ~/Downloads/spotify-history.json data/

# Your agent can then reference them
# "Load the CSV file from the data/ folder and analyze it"
```

## Security Note

The `.gitignore` file is configured to never commit files from this folder (except this .gitkeep file). However, always double-check with `git status` before committing to ensure no personal data is staged.
