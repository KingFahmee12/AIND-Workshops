# Examples

This folder contains example "Wrapped" projects created during testing and workshop preparation.

Each example demonstrates:
- A different data source
- How to work with that type of data
- Creative visualization approaches
- Example prompts used with AI agents

These examples are meant to inspire, not to copy directly. Your wrapped should be personal and creative!
